<h1>The Table 2 Fallacy</h1>
<p>This is based on lecture notes prepared together 
with <a href="https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/clinical-population-science/staff/361/professor-mark-s-gilthorpe">
Mark
Gilthorpe</a>
for his module "Advanced Modelling Strategies".</p>

<p>
<a href="roles.html">As you know,</a> 
the covariates in a statistical analysis
can have a variety of different roles from 
a causal inference perspective:
they can be mediators, confounders, proxy confounders, 
or competing exposures.
If a suitable set of
covariates can be identified that removes confounding, 
we may proceed to estimate our causal effect using a 
multivariable regression model. In linear regression 
models, there are only two
types of variables: the dependent variable (DV) and
independent variables (IVs, or predictors).
No further distinction is made between the IVs – 
specifically, the exposure is by no means a
"special" IV and is treated just like any other IV. 
Thus, as you can see, there is a conceptual
mismatch between causal theory (DAG) that leads 
us to formulate a multivariable regression
model (that highlights the exposure-outcome 
relationship and associated statistical adjustment
for confounding) and the regression model itself. 
This conceptual mismatch can easily lead to
misinterpretation of the results from a multivariable 
regression model.
</p>

<h2>Mutual Adjustment</h2>

<p>
One particularly widespread misconception is known as 
<em>mutual adjustment</em>, recently called the
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kws412">Table 2 fallacy</a> since the first table in most epidemiological 
articles usually describes the study
data, and the second table reports the results of a 
multivariable regression model where the
erroneous efforts to illustrate mutual adjustment often
appear. To illustrate the fallacy, let us
assume that we estimate the effect of X on Y. We know 
(e.g. from a DAG) that there is only
one confounder, Z, so we run the regression Y~X+Z. If our 
background knowledge and the
statistical assumptions of the regression (e.g. normality) 
hold, then the coefficient of X
estimates the causal effect of X on Y. The ‘Table 2 fallacy’ 
is the belief that we can also
interpret the coefficient of Z as the effect of Z on Y; 
indeed, in larger models, the fallacy is the
belief that all coefficients have a similar interpretation 
with respect to Y.
</p>

<p>
To see why this is not true, let us look at an example DAG
that matches our scenario. 
</p>

<div style="width:50%; text-align:center; font-style: italic">
	Figure 1
</div>
<div class="dagitty mediumg-twolines" data-interactive="false">
digraph G {
	X [pos="1,1"]
	Y [pos="2,0"]
	Z [pos="0,0"]
	Z -> Y
	Z -> X -> Y
}
</div>

<p>
With respect to the effect of X on Y,
adjustment for Z removes all confounding, but what
does including X in the model mean for the effect of
Z on Y?
</p>

<p>
As we can see, X <em>mediates</em> the effect of 
Z on Y, but adjustment for a mediator is erroneous
when estimating the total causal effect.
Thus, the Z coefficient in our model cannot be interpreted as
a total causal effect.
Instead, we could interpret it as the <em>direct effect</em> 
of Z on Y when X is held constant;
this could be stronger than, weaker than, or opposite to 
the total effect (see <a href="../simpson/index.html">Simpson's paradox</a>).
</p>

	<h2>The role of confounding</h2>

	<p>
		Thus far it would 
		seem that we can
		at least interpret every coefficient in a multivariable regression
		model as eiter a total or a direct causal effect.
		To see that this can also fail, let us add another
		variable to our DAG. We include U, which affects
		both Z and Y:
	<p>

	<div style="width:50%; text-align:center; font-style: italic">
		Figure 2
	</div>
	<pre class="dagitty largeg-threelines" data-interactive="false">
	dag G {
		X [pos="1,1"]
		Y [pos="2,0"]
		Z [pos="0,0"]
		U [pos=".7,-1"]
		Z -> Y
		U -> Y
		U -> Z -> X -> Y
	}
	</pre>


	<p>
		Despite this new variable,
		it is still sufficient to adjust for Z alone to unconfound the
		X→Y effect (can you see why?). Thus, the validity of
		the X coefficient is unchanged. Upon examining Z
		in this situation, however, we encounter difficulties.
	</p>

	<p>
The new variable U acts as a confounder of the Z→Y relationship, which means that we would
have to interpret the Z coefficient as a ‘direct effect that is confounded by U’ – not exactly a
helpful interpretation. Indeed, no single multivariable regression model could ever estimate
the causal effects of X and Z at the same time: estimating the X effect means we must include
X as an IV, but to estimate the Z effect we must not include X. In general, it is impossible to
identify multiple causal effects using a single regression model, and we can usually interpret at
most one coefficient in such a model as a (total) causal effect.

<div class="exercise">
<h2>Test your knowledge!</h2>

<p>
Suppose Y is regressed on <b>all other variables in the DAG</b>
 below, <b>except for U</b>.
Now look to see which coefficients in this model can be interpreted as 
(unconfounded) <b>total effects</b> or (unconfounded) <b>direct effects</b>? 
Please click on all coefficients that can be interpreted as unconfounded, 
and then click <button onclick="solve2()">solve</button>!

<div class="dagitty gameg" id="g2">
dag G {
	X -> Y
}
</div>
</div>

<p>
	If we are interested in multiple causal effects, we need multiple regression
	models. In Figure 2, we can get the effect of X from the model Y~X+Z because adjustment for Z unconfounds the X→Y effect; and we can get the effect of Z from the model Y~Z+U because adjustment for U unconfounds the Z → Y effect.
</p>

	<h2>The bottom line</h2>
	<p>
		The concept of ‘mutual adjustment’, as often encountered in
		the literature, is seriously misleading.
