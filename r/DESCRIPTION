Title: Graphical Analysis of Structural Causal Models
Version: 0.1-9
Date: 2016-03-22
Author: Johannes Textor, Benito van der Zander
Maintainer: Johannes Textor <johannes.textor@gmx.de>
Description: A port of the web-based software "DAGitty" for analyzing
    structural causal models (also known as directed acyclic graphs or DAGs).
    The package computes covariate adjustment sets for estimating causal
    effects, enumerates instrumental variables, derives testable
    implications (d-separation and vanishing tetrads), generates equivalent
    models, and includes a simple facility for data simulation.
